Ti.MaterialRangeBar
===================

MaterialRangeBar is a fork of https://github.com/edmodo/range-bar that adds some basic material styling, as well as start and end values, values as floats and some other things. It is aiming to mimic this:

It is similar to an enhanced SeekBar widget, though it doesn't make use of the SeekBar. It provides for the selection of a range of values as well as for a single value. The selectable range values are discrete values designated by tick marks; the pin (handle) will snap to the nearest tick mark. This is my first library project, apologies for poor coding, etc etc.

Supported on API Level 12 and above for animations.
